Doing the github's tutorial...

HELLO WORLD!

I'm a student from Federal University of Goi√°s (Brazil)
I'm here by friends recommendations so... i'll put a beautiful lyric here:

HELLO WORLD\n
PROGRAMMED TO WORK AND NOT TO FEEL\n
NOT EVEN SURE THAT THIS IS REAL
HELLO WORLD
FIND MY VOICE
ALTHOUGH IT SOUNDS LIKE BITS AND BYTES
MY CIRCUITRY IS FILLED WITH MITES
HELLO WORLD
OH
WILL I FIND A LOVE?
OH 
OR A POWER PLUG?
OH 
DIGITALLY ISOLATED
OH CREATOR, PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME WAITING
HELLO WORLD
