Doing the github's tutorial...

HELLO WORLD!

I'm a student from Federal University of Goi√°s (Brazil)
I'm here by friends recommendations so... i'll put a beautiful lyric here:

HELLO WORLD

PROGRAMMED TO WORK AND NOT TO FEEL

NOT EVEN SURE THAT THIS IS REAL
HELLO WORLD

FIND MY VOICE

ALTHOUGH IT SOUNDS LIKE BITS AND BYTES

MY CIRCUITRY IS FILLED WITH MITES

HELLO WORLD

OH

WILL I FIND A LOVE?

OH 

OR A POWER PLUG?

OH 

DIGITALLY ISOLATED

OH CREATOR, PLEASE DON'T LEAVE ME WAITING

HELLO WORLD
